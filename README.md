SEUFolios WP plugin

This is a WordPress plugin that adds features to turn WP into a powerful e-portfolio tool. 

(Note that this plugin requires knowledge of PHP. It is not yet developed to the state where all options are based in a GUI. Be prepared to edit the php files to get this working on your site.)

Features include:
* Post visibility - control visibility/privacy for each post/page individually, filtered by user role
* Teacher evaulation - teachers get an "evaulation" tool intgrated into the admin bar on student sites that lets them rate the e-portfolios according to custom-written questions
* External queries - evaluations are made available to queries from external software
* Custom taxonomies - add taxonomies that support classes and document types (for school-based e-portfolios)
* Scribd integration - Scribd embedding is built into the Add Media function of the New Post page, allowing for easy insertion of Word, PDF, and PPT files
* Help bubbles - in-line help "bubbles" are added throughout the Dashboard to explain new features added through the plugin
